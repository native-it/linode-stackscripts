# Linode Stackscripts

*These scripts are unlikely to suit anyone else out-of-the-box, but most are commented clearly and can easily be modified to suit.*

* Filenames beginning with a '*0*' indicate helper scripts to be used as includes.
* Visit [Linode Docs](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/writing-scripts-for-use-with-linode-stackscripts-a-tutorial/) for more information on writing Stackscripts.
